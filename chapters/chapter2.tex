\chapter{Literature Review}
We focus on several related problems under the domain of human motion analysis and synthesis. In this section, we will consider the related works on these problems. We will first start with active human pose estimation and introduce works which focus on pose estimation while taking the camera placement into account. Afterwards, we discuss works on human motion prediction and introduce the deep learning architectures that are primarily being used. Finally, we discuss the physical exercise analysis field, for which we first introduce the more general field of action recognition, then focus on works that primarily target sports applications.

\section{Active Human Pose Estimation}
Most recent approaches to 3D pose estimation rely on deep networks that regress pose from...

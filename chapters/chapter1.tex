\chapter{Introduction}
It has become increasingly popular to develop computer vision applications which are either directly or indirectly focused on human motion. In many cases, detecting and analyzing human motion is the main objective, as in sports analysis \cite{Takahashi1996Structure, Xia2002Analysis}, or surveillance \cite{Jiang1989}. In many other applications, analyzing human motions is not the main task, but a crucial component of the application. For instance, the main focus of self-driving cars is to draw a safe path for the car to navigate within traffic. However in order to avoid dangerous situations, it is imperative for the vehicle to have a sense of whether there are pedestrians around, what they are doing, and where they will go next. In all of such computer vision applications, careful design of human motion algorithms is key.

\section{Motivation and Applications}
Human motion analysis and synthesis plays a key role in many real-world applications. For many developing technologies, such as autonomous driving, accurate analysis of human motion is integral to the feasibility of bringing... \cite{Takahashi1996Structure,Jiang1989}

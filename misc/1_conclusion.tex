\begin{conclusion}
We have addressed several problems in the field of human motion analysis and synthesis, namely active viewpoint selection for human pose estimation, human motion prediction, and physical exercise feedback and analysis. We summarize our findings in this chapter, and discuss directions for future research.

\section{Summary}
Human motion analysis and synthesis is an important research direction for many computer vision applications in fields such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and entertainment. We tackle several problems in this domain.

In Chapter 3, we address...
